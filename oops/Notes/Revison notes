static and public :

we created a static method, which means that it can be accessed without creating an object of the class,
unlike public, which can only be accessed by objects.


Java Constructors :

A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects.
The constructor is called when an object of a class is created. It can be used to set initial values for object attributes.
