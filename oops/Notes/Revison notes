static and public :

we created a static method, which means that it can be accessed without creating an object of the class,
unlike public, which can only be accessed by objects.


Java Constructors :

A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects.
The constructor is called when an object of a class is created. It can be used to set initial values for object attributes.

Enums
An enum is a special "class" that represents a group of constants (unchangeable variables, like final variables).
Enum is short for "enumerations",

An enum can, just like a class, have attributes and methods. The only difference is that enum constants are public, static and final (unchangeable - cannot be overridden).

An enum cannot be used to create objects, and it cannot extend other classes (but it can implement interfaces).

Why And When To Use Enums?

Use enums when you have values that you know aren't going to change, like month days, days, colors, deck of cards, etc.
